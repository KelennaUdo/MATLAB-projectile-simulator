# MATLAB-projectile-simulator
The Projectile Simulator is a MATLAB application designed to analyze and visualize the trajectory of a projectile based on user input.
It offers two modes of operation: 

1. Manual Input Mode:
In this mode, the user inputs the initial speed and direction of the projectile in 
the x-y-z coordinate system. The application then calculates and plots the trajectory of the projectile. 
Additionally, it provides essential projection parameters such as total time of flight, time to reach 
maximum height, maximum height attained, displacement, and landing velocity.

2. Targeted Projection Mode:
The user specifies the desired distance to project the projectile and the 
projection angle relative to the ground. This mode can be used to calculate the launch velocity 
required to reach a certain distance at a given launch angle (any angle can be used, but the maximum 
height and launch velocity would vary). The application then computes the trajectory and projection 
parameters, including total time of flight, time to reach maximum height, maximum height, 
displacement, landing velocity, velocity magnitude, and velocity direction.

Assumptions made: 
1. Gravity = 9.81m/s2 
2. Air resistance is negligible  

To run the program, run script.m
